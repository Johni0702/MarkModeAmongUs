# MarkModeAmongUs
A mod for Among Us

The idea is basically: Everyone is Mark and everyone is orange. You can only refer to other players as Mark.
The name and color can be changed in the settings in MarkModeMain.cs though.

# Installation
Install Reactor Modding Framework according to https://docs.reactor.gg/docs/ and drop the compiled dll in the BepInEx/Plugins folder.

# Development
Install Reactor Modding Framework according to https://docs.reactor.gg/docs/ and open the project in Visual Studio or a compatible IDE.
You will need to get some information and files (like a disassembled and disobfuscated Among Us) to work on this. A good place to start is the Reactor Discord and the ExtraRolesAmongUs Mod at https://github.com/NotHunter101/ExtraRolesAmongUs.
