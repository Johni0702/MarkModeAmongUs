# MarkModeAmongUs
A mod for Among Us

The idea is basically: Everyone is Mark and everyone is orange. You can only refer to other players as Mark.
The name and color can be changed in the settings in MarkModeMain.cs though.

# Installation
Install Reactor Modding Framework according to the [Reactor Docs](https://docs.reactor.gg/docs/) and drop the compiled dll in the BepInEx/Plugins folder. Every player needs to have the mod installed.

# Development
Install Reactor Modding Framework according to the [Reactor Docs](https://docs.reactor.gg/docs/) and open the project in Visual Studio 
or a compatible IDE.
You will need to get some information and files (like a disassembled and disobfuscated Among Us) to work on this. A good place to start 
is the [Reactor Discord](https://discord.gg/Zcmsb9UGuq) and the [ExtraRolesAmongUs Mod](https://github.com/NotHunter101/ExtraRolesAmongUs).
